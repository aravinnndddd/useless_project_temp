### Project Description
We thought about measuring the diameter of a parippuvada ‚Äî because some snacks deserve scientific attention.
Then we said, why stop there? Let‚Äôs throw in vazhakkappam too (measuring length for that one, obviously).
It might be too useless at some points, but what if we compared two parippuvadas, sold at the same price, and proved snack injustice exists? Just like siblings comparing who got the bigger piece. üôÉ
We are building a completely unnecessary but utterly delightful web app to measure the diameter (and maybe area) of Kerala snacks like vazhakkappam, parippuvada and also samosas as a bonus.
Thickness? Nope. We are snack minimalists.And of course, samosa will be treated with the respect it deserves ‚Äî measured using Heron‚Äôs formula for maximum mathematical overkill.
Let‚Äôs vadafy and kadify this thing üòé

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Snack lovers across Kerala are living in uncertainty. They don‚Äôt know if their parippuvada?vazhaikappam is the same size as their friend‚Äôs.
Snack inequality is real (probably).
Nobody is measuring, and that‚Äôs the hole in our research ‚Äî quite literally.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We solve snack injustice by:
- Letting you upload or snap a photo of your snack.
- Using basic image processing + geometry to measure its size.
- Showing you a fun, dramatic verdict on whether your snack is the champion or a snack underdog.
- Maintaining a leaderboard of the largest snacks in the session, because competition makes everything better.
- For samosas, we measure all three sides and apply Heron‚Äôs formula because triangles deserve maths too.
